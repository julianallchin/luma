# Repository Guidelines

Luma is a Tauri desktop app: a React/TypeScript frontend in `src/` backed by a Rust core in `src-tauri/`. Most features span both halves via Tauri `invoke()` commands and shared TypeScript bindings.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/`: React 19 + TypeScript UI, Zustand stores, React Flow-based graph editors, Tailwind styling.
  - Feature modules live in `src/features/*` (e.g., `patterns/`, `track-editor/`, `app/`).
  - Shared UI/components in `src/shared/`.
- `src-tauri/`: Rust backend (entry `src-tauri/src/main.rs`, app setup in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs`).
  - Models in `src-tauri/src/models/`.
  - SQLite + migrations in `src-tauri/migrations/{app,project}`.
  - Python workers in `src-tauri/python/` for beats/roots/stems analysis.
- `projects/`: example venue projects (`*.luma`).
- `resources/fixtures/`: fixture definitions bundled into the app.
- `experiments/`: research notebooks and test data.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

Use **Bun only** for JS tooling.

- `bun install`: install JS deps.
- `bun run dev`: run Vite dev server.
- `bun run tauri dev`: run desktop app with hot reload (Vite + Tauri).
- `bun run build`: typecheck + build frontend to `dist/`.
- `bun run tauri build`: produce distributable desktop build.
- `bun run lint`: Biome lint for TS + `cargo clippy` for Rust.
- `bun run format`: Biome format + `cargo fmt`.
- `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml`: run Rust tests and regenerate TS bindings (see below).

## Code Philosophy

Delete dead code — don't comment it out, don't keep it "just in case". If something is being replaced, remove the old thing entirely. No backwards-compatibility shims unless there's a concrete reason (e.g. a migration that must stay). When changing something fundamental, change it all the way.

Every change earns its complexity. Aim for elegant, simple diffs that compose well with what's already there. Reach for an abstraction only when it compresses real duplication or unifies a concept — not preemptively. Encapsulate invariants at the layer that owns them: enforce them inside the type, function, or DB constraint that's actually responsible, not scattered across callers (a TOCTOU pre-check from a caller is almost always weaker than a constraint enforced atomically below). If the same idea can be expressed with one less concept, do.

When you spot a smell adjacent to your work — a leaky abstraction, a guard that only fires on the happy path, error handling that hides the original cause, a comment papering over rot, dead branches — flag it explicitly in your response. You don't have to fix everything in one pass, but the human reviewing your work should know what you saw and chose not to touch.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript/React: formatted and linted by Biome (`biome.json`). Prefer functional components, hooks, and Zustand stores named `use-*-store.ts`. Files and folders are generally kebab-case; components are PascalCase.
- Rust: standard `rustfmt` + `clippy`. Keep backend modules cohesive around domains (`tracks`, `patterns`, `annotations`, `host_audio`).
- Cross-boundary API: add/rename Tauri commands in `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` and update frontend call sites under `src/features/**`.

## TypeScript Bindings (`ts-rs`)

Bindings are auto-generated from Rust structs in `src-tauri/src/models/` using `ts-rs`.

- Output file: `src/bindings/schema.ts` (ignored by git).
- Regeneration: happens automatically on `cargo test`.
- If you change exported Rust models, run `cargo test --manifest-path src-tauri/Cargo.toml` to refresh bindings.
- Do **not** commit generated `src/bindings/schema.ts`.

## Testing Guidelines

There is no dedicated JS test suite yet. Validate UI changes manually via `bun run tauri dev`. Rust changes should be covered with `cargo test` when possible. Keep migrations consistent with model changes.

## Data & File Locations

The global library database `luma.db` is stored in the Tauri app config directory:

- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/com.luma.luma/luma.db`
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\\com.luma.luma\\luma.db`
- Linux: `~/.config/com.luma.luma/luma.db`

Venue projects are SQLite `.luma` files, created/opened via the UI and stored wherever the user chooses (samples in `projects/`).

## UI Conventions

- **Confirmation dialogs**: Use the `AlertDialog` component from `@/shared/components/ui/alert-dialog` for destructive confirmations (delete, discard, etc.). Do **not** use the native Tauri `ask()` dialog from `@tauri-apps/plugin-dialog`.

## Version Bumps & Releases

When bumping the version, update **all three files** together: `package.json`, `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, and `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`. They can drift out of sync if any one is missed.

To trigger a production release build, push a version tag after committing:

```
git tag v0.x.y && git push origin v0.x.y
```

Pushing to `main` alone does **not** trigger a build — the tag is required.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

Follow conventional, imperative commits (e.g., `add track annotation drag`, `fix waveform cache`). PRs should include:

- a clear summary of behavior changes,
- linked issues or context,
- screenshots/video for UI changes,
- notes on any schema/migration impacts.

## Groups & Selection

Groups are the core mechanism for targeting fixtures in scores. A score never references specific fixtures — it references **group names**, and each venue defines its own groups of physical fixtures.

### How it works

- **Groups** are user-created collections of fixtures within a venue (e.g., `front_wash`, `drum_uplighters`, `back_movers`). Each group has a snake_case name and optional axis positions (LR/FB/AB) for spatial selection.
- **Selection expressions** in scores reference group names with boolean operators (`front_wash & left_movers`, `drum_uplighters | dj_booth > back_wash`). The `all` keyword selects every fixture. At runtime, the expression resolves to whichever fixtures belong to the named groups in the current venue.
- **Venue portability**: When moving a score between venues, an LLM can remap group names (e.g., `front_wash` in venue A → `house_pars` in venue B).

### Group naming

Group names are automatically normalized to snake_case: lowercase, spaces/hyphens become underscores, non-alphanumeric characters are stripped. Names must match `[a-z][a-z0-9_]*` and cannot be `all`.

### Key files

- `src-tauri/src/models/groups.rs` — `FixtureGroup`, name normalization/validation helpers
- `src-tauri/src/services/groups.rs` — hierarchy building, selection expression parser/evaluator, spatial filtering
- `src-tauri/src/database/local/groups.rs` — group CRUD, membership
- `src-tauri/src/commands/groups.rs` — Tauri commands for groups
- `src/features/universe/components/grouped-fixture-tree.tsx` — UI for managing groups
- `src/features/universe/components/group-expression-editor.tsx` — autocomplete editor for group selection expressions
