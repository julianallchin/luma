Bindings for TypeScript are auto-generated from Rust structs located in `src-tauri/src/models/` using `ts-rs`.
The generated bindings are exported to `src/bindings/schema.ts`.
These bindings are regenerated automatically when you run `cargo test`.
If you make changes to the exported Rust models, you should manually run `cargo test` to update the bindings.
