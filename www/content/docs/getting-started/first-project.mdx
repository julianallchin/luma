# Your First Project

This guide walks you through creating your first Luma project and understanding the basic workflow.

## Understanding the Workflow

Luma uses a two-database architecture:

1. **Global Library** (`luma.db`): Your personal collection of tracks and patterns
2. **Venue Project** (`project.luma`): Hardware configuration for a specific location

## Step 1: Import a Track

1. Open Luma
2. Navigate to the **Library** view
3. Drag and drop an audio file (MP3, WAV, FLAC)
4. Luma will analyze the track for beats, tempo, and structure

## Step 2: Create a Venue Project

1. Go to **File → New Venue Project**
2. Choose a location to save the `.luma` file
3. This creates a blank project for your specific hardware setup

## Step 3: Configure Your Fixtures

1. Switch to the **Universe** view
2. Add fixtures from the built-in library
3. Assign DMX addresses
4. Create semantic groups (e.g., "Ceiling", "Floor", "Blinders")

## Step 4: Annotate Your Track

1. Select a track from your library
2. Open the **Track Editor**
3. Place pattern blocks on the timeline
4. Adjust timing and parameters

## Step 5: Run the Show

1. Switch to the **Visualizer** view
2. Hit play to see your lights in action
3. Adjust patterns and groupings in real-time
