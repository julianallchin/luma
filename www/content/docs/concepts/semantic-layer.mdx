# The Semantic Layer

The semantic layer is Luma's core innovation. It's the abstraction that enables "write once, perform anywhere" lighting design.

## The Problem with Traditional Lighting

Traditional lighting consoles record **literal commands**:

```
Frame 1: Fixture 101 → Red, 100%
Frame 2: Fixture 101 → Red, 80%
Frame 3: Fixture 101 → Red, 60%
...
```

This approach has critical limitations:

- **Hardware-locked**: The show only works with the exact fixtures it was programmed on
- **Venue-dependent**: Moving to a new venue means reprogramming everything
- **AI-hostile**: The data is too noisy for machine learning

## Luma's Approach: Intent Over Instructions

Luma records **semantic intent**:

```
0:00 - 0:30  → "Warm_Wash_Slow"
0:30 - 1:00  → "Beat_Pulse_Red"
1:00 - 1:02  → "Strobe_Impact"
```

The *meaning* is preserved. The *execution* is delegated to the venue.

## The Musical Score Analogy

Think of it like sheet music:

| Musical Score | Luma Score |
|--------------|------------|
| "Play C-Major Chord" | "Play Red Circular Pulse" |
| Works on piano, guitar, synth | Works on clubs, arenas, festivals |
| Performer interprets dynamics | Venue interprets hardware |

## Components of the Semantic Layer

### Patterns

Named, parameterized concepts in your lighting vocabulary:

- `Strobe_Chaos` - Chaotic, high-energy strobe effect
- `Warm_Wash_Fade` - Slow amber fade across all fixtures
- `Beat_Pulse` - Intensity pulses on each beat

### Annotations

Time-positioned pattern placements on a track:

```typescript
{
  trackId: "abc123",
  annotations: [
    { start: 0, end: 30, pattern: "Warm_Wash_Slow" },
    { start: 30, end: 60, pattern: "Beat_Pulse_Red" }
  ]
}
```

### Implementations

How a venue translates patterns to hardware (lives in the venue project):

```
Pattern: "Beat_Pulse_Red"
Group: "Ceiling"
Behavior: Chase across all fixtures, 1 beat cycle, red
```

## Why This Matters

The semantic layer enables:

1. **Portability**: Your shows work on any venue
2. **AI Training**: Clean data for machine learning
3. **Collaboration**: Share shows without sharing hardware configs
4. **Rapid Iteration**: Change implementations without touching annotations
