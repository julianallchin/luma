# Position Nodes

Position nodes compute aiming angles for moving lights based on fixture positions and target coordinates.

## Look At Position

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type ID** | `look_at_position` |
| **Category** | Position |
| **Description** | Computes pan/tilt angles to aim each fixture at a target 3D point. |

### Inputs

| Port | Type | Required |
|------|------|----------|
| `selection` | Selection | Yes |
| `x` | Signal | Yes |
| `y` | Signal | Yes |
| `z` | Signal | Yes |

### Outputs

| Port | Type |
|------|------|
| `pan` | Signal (degrees) |
| `tilt` | Signal (degrees) |

### Parameters

None.

### Behavior

- Computes inverse kinematics for each fixture based on its position and orientation.
- Accounts for fixture mounting angle.
- Output angles are in degrees, suitable for direct connection to `apply_position`.
