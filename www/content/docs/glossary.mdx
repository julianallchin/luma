## Core Concepts

### Venue

A project container representing a physical space. Contains fixture patches, groups, tags, and annotations. Venues translate abstract patterns into concrete hardware instructions.

### Patched Fixture

A fixture instance assigned to a venue at a specific DMX universe and address, with 3D position and rotation.

### Head

An independently-controllable segment of a multi-head fixture. A pixel bar with 12 pixels has 12 heads. A simple par can has 1 head. Head positions are computed from the fixture definition's physical dimensions and the fixture's 3D placement.

- **Addressing:** `fixture_id:head_index` (e.g., `"abc123:0"`, `"abc123:1"`)

### DMX Universe

A group of 512 DMX channels (addresses 1-512). Standard DMX-512 protocol term. A venue can span multiple universes.

### Group

A logical collection of fixtures organized by role and spatial position, not by DMX address. Groups are the bridge between abstract patterns and physical hardware -- they enable venue portability.

- **Spatial Axes:** axis_lr (left/right), axis_fb (front/back), axis_ab (above/below) -- each -1.0 to +1.0

### Tag

A label attached to a group that patterns use for fixture selection. Three categories:

- **Auto-generated spatial tags:** `left`, `right`, `center`, `front`, `back`, `high`, `low`, `circular` (computed from fixture positions)
- **Capability tags:** `has_color`, `has_movement`, `has_strobe` (detected from fixture definitions)
- **User-defined tags:** Custom labels like `blinder`, `wash`, `spot`

### Tag Expression

A boolean query over tags used by `select` nodes. Operators: `&` (AND), `|` (OR), `^` (XOR), `~` (NOT), `>` (fallback), with parentheses for grouping.

Examples: `front & has_color`, `circular & ~blinder`, `has_movement > has_color`.

### Pattern

A reusable, venue-agnostic light behavior defined as a visual node graph. Contains one or more implementations (graph versions).

### Implementation

A specific node graph version of a pattern. Contains the serialized graph (nodes, edges, pattern arguments).

### Graph

The node-and-edge data flow graph within an implementation. Nodes are processing units, edges connect output ports to input ports, and pattern arguments expose configurable parameters.

### Signal

A 3D tensor -- the fundamental data type flowing through pattern graphs. Three dimensions:

- **N (spatial):** Number of fixtures (or 1 for uniform)
- **T (temporal):** Time samples across the pattern duration
- **C (channel):** Data channels per sample (1=dimmer, 3=RGB, 4=RGBA, 2=pan/tilt, 12=chroma)
- **Broadcasting:** Dimensions of size 1 expand to match larger operands (like NumPy)

### Annotation (Score)

A pattern placement on a track's timeline. Defines when a pattern plays, its stacking order, blend mode, and argument values.

### Blend Mode

How overlapping annotations combine during compositing. Applied per-layer in z-index order (bottom to top):

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Replace** | Top overwrites bottom |
| **Add** | Sum, clamped to 1.0 |
| **Multiply** | Product (darkening) |
| **Screen** | Inverse multiply (lightening) |
| **Max / Lighten** | Take brightest |
| **Min** | Take dimmest |
| **Value** | Top brightness controls mix amount |

### Track

An audio file with metadata and analysis data (beat grid, waveforms, separated stems, chord analysis).

### PrimitiveState

Runtime output values for a single fixture/head at a single moment. Contains dimmer (0-1), color (RGB 0-1), strobe (0-1), position (pan/tilt in degrees), and speed (0/1).

### UniverseState

All fixture states at a single point in time. Despite the name, represents fixture output state, not a DMX universe.
