# Welcome to Luma

Luma is a desktop application for **semantic lighting control**. Instead of recording hardware-specific DMX instructions, Luma records your artistic intent -- creating a universal language for light shows that works on any venue.

Think of it like the difference between **sheet music** and an **audio recording**. Sheet music says "play a C major chord" and it works on piano, guitar, synthesizer, anything. A recording is locked to the specific instrument that played it. Luma is sheet music for lighting. Your creative work travels with you. The venue provides the instruments.

## How It Works

Luma separates **what you want** (your creative intent) from **how to do it** (venue-specific hardware):

1. **Your Library** -- Your creative identity. Tracks, patterns, annotations. Completely hardware-agnostic. Syncs through the cloud.

2. **Venues** -- How your library gets translated into a specific room's equipment. A venue knows what lights are in the room, where they are, and what they can do.
