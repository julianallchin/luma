# Welcome to Luma

Luma is a desktop application for **semantic lighting control**. Instead of recording hardware-specific instructions, Luma records your artistic *intent*—creating a universal language for light shows.

## The Core Philosophy

The fundamental problem with current lighting control software is that it's strictly "literal." When you program a show on a traditional console, you're recording specific instructions for specific hardware:

> "Turn fixture #101 to 50% brightness"

If you move that show to a different venue with different hardware, the instructions become meaningless.

Luma solves this by treating a light show like a **musical score** rather than a mechanical recording:

- **Musical Score (Intent):** "Play a C-Major Chord" works on any instrument
- **Luma Score:** "Play a Red Circular Pulse" works on any venue

## Two Distinct Halves

Luma cleanly separates the **artistic domain** from the **technical domain**:

### The Global Library (`luma.db`)

Your creative identity—music, analysis data, and artistic decisions. Completely blind to hardware.

- **Pattern Registry**: The vocabulary of semantic lighting concepts
- **Track Annotations**: Time-synced pattern placements on audio

### The Venue Project (`project.luma`)

The translator for a specific physical location.

- **Implementation Layer**: How abstract patterns become real on this equipment
- **Semantic Groups**: Logical groupings like "Ceiling" or "Blinders"
